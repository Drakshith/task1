        <h2 style="text-align:center;text-shadow: 20px;font:200;">About the legend</h2>
        <p>&#9758;Vallabhbhai Patel was born in Nadiad, Gujarat, on October 31, 1875.</p>
        <p>&#9758;He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a leading role in the country's struggle for independence, guiding its integration into a united, independent nation.</p>
        <p>&#9758;He was one of the conservative members of the Indian National Congress.</p>
        <p>&#9758;In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.</p>
        <p>&#9758;In September 1917, Patel delivered a speech in Borsad, encouraging Indians nationwide to sign Gandhi's petition demanding Swaraj – self-rule – from Britain.</p>
        <p>&#9758;One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat.</p>
        <p>&#9758; He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.</p>
        <p>&#9758;Patel persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India. His commitment to national integration in the newly independent country was total and uncompromising, earning him the sobriquet "Iron Man of India"</p>
        <p>&#9758;Patel was a selfless leader, who placed the country’s interests above everything else and shaped India’s destiny with single-minded devotion.The invaluable contribution of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in building a modern and unified India needs to be remembered by every Indian as the country marches ahead as one of the largest economies in the world.</p>
        <p>&#9758;Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day) was introduced by the Government of India and inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. The intent is to pay tribute to Patel, who was instrumental in keeping India united. </p>
        <p>&#9758;The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government at a cost of USD420 million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height.</p>
        <p>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s Quotes:</p>
    <h4><p style="text-align:center;">“Work is worship but laughter is life. Anyone who takes life too seriously must prepare himself for a miserable existence. Anyone who greets joys and sorrows with equal facility can really get the best of life.”</p></h4>
